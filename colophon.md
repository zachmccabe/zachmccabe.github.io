Updated: {% include print_update.html %}

I really want this site to work for you: Even if you're on an old phone; Even if you're standing outside an airport waiting for the bus; Even if the library wi-fi is slow as hell. To that end, I've chosen the approach explained here.

Tell me what you think. Your feedback makes this site better: <hello@zachmccabe.com>

### Our correspondence

I delete ephemeral correspondence immediately. However, you should *also* know that:

1. US regulations require that I retain some business-related correspondence for several years.
2. Because I'm human, I take notes for myself. I keep my digital notes encrypted -- for the same reason. ü§ê
