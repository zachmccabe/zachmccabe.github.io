Email is the best way to reach me.

Say hi. Collaborations and new clients are welcome. You can expect a reply to business emails within 2 days. 

Postcards from hotel quarantine always receive a quick reply.

Everything else will get a more leisurely response.

If you have feedback or a question about the Photographers Field Guide to Beijing, please email me.  I'd love to hear about your experience. Also, you can check the field guide [FAQ.]

I'm based in north Texas. The local timezone is US Central. (This maps to UTC -5 during daylight savings time, which lasts 8 months of the year.)
