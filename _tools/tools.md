Updated: {% include print_update.html %} • List of some favorite things I'm using right now for work (and life).



{% include page_nav.html %}



## Time and mind mgmt

+ Orgzly on Android
+ Pomodoro technique for screen-based stuff
+ Quick 10 minutes of sitting meditation, and a good hour of walking



## Office things

Switched from a standing desk to a floor desk. Everything is built using Elfa modular shelving racks and raw pine so it was real easy. Not sure how long I'll keep it this way.

+ AP Stylebook
+ Pandemic fern
+ Speedy Stitcher sewing awl

The nitty gritty from my digital publishing workflow is in this [colophon] from my field guide.

## Digital asset mgmt

+ Plaintext is forever
+ Rclone
+ Syncthing on Android + Mac
+ When needed, metadata spelunking with ExifTool

If you're curious, see how this works in the [project notes] I wrote up for Laughing Lost in Briars.

## Field things

+ Dish soap and cold water to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak bags keep my electronics clean and dry
+ Because I work and play outside, I like to have these weather tools on my phone:
  - droughtmonitor.unl.edu
  - @nwsftworth
  - Radarscope
  - texaswildfirerisk.com
  - Joshua Tee’s [wX app]
  - yr.no

## Longevity

+ Pleco with lots of add-ons

More than 10 years ago, I bought my first smartphone just to get Pleco's suite of Chinese language tools and dictionaries. Many smartphones later, it's still my favorite app.

+ The DAM Book
+ Photo Mechanic v6

Along with Photo Mechanic, Peter Krogh's The DAM Book has been helping me manage my picture archive for nearly a decade.

Whenever I travel, go to the museum or read a bit of [archaeology,] it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
