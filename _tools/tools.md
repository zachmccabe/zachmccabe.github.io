## Time and mind management

+ Nix notifications, thx
+ Orgzly on Android
+ Pomodoro technique for screen-based stuff
+ Quick 10 minutes of sitting meditation, and a good hour of walking (more on this later; I find it challenging to write about)




## Digital asset management

+ [ExifTool] for metadata spelunking
+ Photo Mechanic for metalogging photos
+ Plaintext is forever
+ Rclone does local sync, too
+ Syncthing on Android + Mac

More detail on one of my [photo workflows] is included in the project notes I wrote up for Laughing Lost in Briars.

## Work and play outside

+ Dish soap and cold water to wash off the poison ivy
+ Loksak zipper bags
+ Weather tools on my phone:
  - droughtmonitor.unl.edu
  - Radarscope
  - Joshua Teeâ€™s [wX app,] which is a mobile-friendly front end for NWS and NOAA data
  - yr.no

## Longevity

+ Mac, 20 years
+ Photo Mechanic app, 15 years
+ Pleco app, 10+ years
+ The DAM Book, 10+ years

I literally bought my first smartphone just so I could get access to Mike Love's suite of Chinese language learning tools and dictionaries. Many smartphones later, Pleco is still my favorite app.

The techniques in Peter Krogh's The DAM Book completely changed how I manage my picture workflow and archive. So good.

Whenever I travel, go to the museum or read a bit of [archaeology,] it is always the stuff people use that raises my eyebrow and makes me smile. Only fair to ante up, eh?
