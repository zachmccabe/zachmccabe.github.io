## Longevity

I've been using [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com) and Photo Mechanic for over a decade.




## Changes

**inbox.google.com**… The Goog giveth and the Goog taketh away.

**Wire**… testing out the Berlin-based messaging app.

**Orgzly**… lovely UX on Android but also trapped on Android because, I guess, I'm just not l33t enough to use terminal and emacs to check my todo list on my computer ;p After my phone died, it was time to find something cross-platform. Still looking. Send help!

**Photo Mechanic v6**… excited to test out the new version but it'll have to wait awhile.
