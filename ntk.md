Updated: {% include print_update.html %} • Hi, friend. This page explains what what you need to know about how this website works.

I *really* want this site to work for you: Even if you're on an old phone; Even if you're standing outside an airport waiting for the bus; Even if the library wi-fi is slow as hell. To that end, I've chosen my ingredients. Let me know how you like the recipe: <hello@zachmccabe.com>.

## Privacy

### Your data

You'll find that this website has 1 cookie, Cloudflare's `__cfduid` cookie. If you're curious about what it does, start with [this.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-)

- I don't collect user data.
- I don't use affiliate links.



### Our correspondence

I delete ephemeral correspondence immediately. However, you should *also* know that:

1. US regulations do require that I retain some business-related correspondence for several years.
2. Because I'm human, I do take notes for myself. I keep my digital notes encrypted -- for the same reason. 🤐
