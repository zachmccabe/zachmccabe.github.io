<span class="lede">Briars is 1 part diary, 1 part social publishing experiment.</span>

Call it meditation, gratitude, delight. I do this to remind myself of the remarkable world right in front of me. Figured Iâ€™d bring a few friends along for the ride.

These are my project notes.

## Project inspiration

Briars is inspired by the ranch where I work as a hand, and by some of my favorite nature journals, too. Mostly, though, it was a chance visit with an old friend that got this project started, and keeps it moving.
 
During a visit to the US, my childhood Chinese teacher (she's a business consultant these days) gave me a notebook filled with details from [Qi Bai Shi's] ink and brush paintings.

Qi's crickets and cicadas were my favorite when I was a kid. His work was so different to anything I'd ever seen. It made me smile. It still does. When my teacher handed me that notebook, she gave me an idea and Briars got its start -- that was 8 years ago.

## Keeping it real

These pictures are made as a diary. The story is nonfiction.

For Briars, like with any story, nonfiction is defined by how you interact with your subject and your audience.

The audience for this project started with friends in China. We grew up in some of the world's biggest cities, in a culture where the expectations surrounding agriculture and nature are different than in the Anglosphere. Those differences fueled my friends' curiosity, and my own.

Briars initially went out to friends via direct message on WeChat, later expanding to Instagram. (Although I no longer use those 2 platforms, I am always tinkering with new ways to share the project.)

Viewed on a phone, these tiny images need to have low information density. I want a concise message and a composition that works at 600px 1:1.

I do my best to remember all this when I frame the scene, choose one picture over another or write a caption. I want to keep it real.




## Researching the story

To learn more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me I use field guides, [iNaturalist,] and [NRCS pubs.] Studying natural history helps me make meaningful pictures. It improves my chances of being in the right place at the right time, too. For example:

- Stay low and don't silhouette when photographing bees, climbing snakes, wasps and other creatures that are preyed on by birds.
- Move softly and deliberately. This is critical when working around things that bite, kick, or shove back.
- To the best of my judgement, I always prioritize the creature's welfare. Sometimes this means walking away without a photo. This post from ILCP is a [good way into that topic.]

## Structuring the story

New for this project is the atomic unit method. 

This modularization strategy is used in design as a way to scale up efficiently. A friend, who is a designer, suggested I look up Brad Frost and experiment with [his method.]

The idea is to divide information and interfaces down into their most basic pieces, and build out from those elements. See this article at [A List Apart] for more.

For Briars, the atomic unit is defined as a diary entry -- a picture and any notes I'll need for caption writing. It's not so different from the classic image-plus-caption structure familiar to photojournalists.

What's new (to me) is how these units flow and scale. Structuring the story this way lets me:

- Jump between social media platforms.
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English.
- Scale up the project over time.

All the other stuff I use is grouped into separate structures, e.g.: 

- Finished captions are a discrete atomic unit of their own; the content, tone and language vary.
- Reference pictures and video, which I use for looking up plant species in a botanical key.

The atomic unit is a powerful conceptual tool that's helped me to organize this multi-platform story. Briars wouldn't have grown without it.

Of course, this story form is everywhere now, thanks to the remarkable success of social media platforms. It feels like the default. But I still remember trying to wrap my head around this [2009 blog post] explaining NPR's "create once, publish everywhere" strategy the first time I read it.

## Publishing workflow

1. Briars is shot with an emphasis on quick turn around. Pictures are nearly always shot as JPG, then cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic on my Mac. Any notes or captions are stored in plaintext files alongside the images.

2. Everything gets moved to my phone so it can be published via mobile apps. I use Syncthing between Mac and Android. Previously, I used Dropbox.

3. Because social platforms optimize image dimensions and file size on their servers, I simply upload a big 1:1 crop of the image so there is plenty of data to use. I don't scale the image down or compress it. For this website I use Nik Output Sharpener on my Mac to prep the scaled-down JPG files.




## Tools and cameras

Portability matters with this project. The technical aspects of image quality are less important. Generally, I only use whatever photo gear I can fit in my pockets.

### Cameras

The first 3-years-worth of images were made with cell phones and a cheap action camera. Then, I switched to a hand-me-down Nikon compact. Right now, I'm using a secondhand Sony RX100 m4.

To add some protection from sweat, dust and rain, I use either a 4x7" Loksak bag or a tiny, #1010 Pelican case.

One useful thing about working with phones and compact cameras is that you don't need to look through a viewfinder. You get to keep your peripheral vision. I've really come to prefer working this way. And I especially appreciate it when the weather is changing fast, or when I'm working near things that can bite, kick or sting. The trade off is that during bright midday sun I can't really see the interface on the screen. Keeps me in the scene, I guess.

### Light

For quick closeups I use a small flashlight. It's the kind of thing you need routinely when you work outside, so I just upgraded what I already had. For the past few years I've been using Jaxman E3 lights, which I run on a single, rechargable AA-size battery. I use both the 4000K and 5700K Nichia versions of this light. Each is rated at 90 CRI.

I also keep a collapsible reflector in my car but I've only used it once. Cattle, in particular, really seem to hate that thing. Camera flash isn't much better. Many critters are more willing to accommodate continuous light, I've found.
