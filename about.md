These days I'm working as a ranch hand, in the good company of ancient oak trees.

In the aughts, I got my start by working as a photographer for local NGO clients in East Asia.

I grew up in the US, China and Japan.

I'm the author and producer of [The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing] and [Laughing Lost in Briars.]

On this website, I share what I'm learning from those projects, and related topics like data and land stewardship, cross-cultural communication.

Most of theses notes are utilitarian. A few are weird! I am sharing these ideas hoping that a few will be interesting to you, too.

Expect combinations, dissections and the occasional deleted page. I’m working with a particular sort of iteration in mind -- are there any interesting connections in this idea heap? Let's find out.
