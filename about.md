## Who I work with

Let's make something! I welcome collaborations, commissions and new clients. [hello@zachmccabe.com](mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com)




## What I do

I'm the author and [producer](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/how_the_book_got_made.html) of "The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing." I used to write about photography for [Empty Easel.](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A+emptyeasel.com+zach+mccabe) Before that, I worked as a photographer for NGO clients.

The focus of my photographic work is long-term projects and image libraries; mostly documentary [nonfiction.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/nonfiction.html)

For many years I've also worked as a ranch hand – I'm a big fan of sunshine. 🍃 That experience informs my ongoing photo project, "Laughing Lost in Briars."



## Where I work

Currently I'm just down the road from DFW Airport in Texas. My friends are all over the map.
