These days I'm working as a ranch hand, in the good company of ancient oak trees.

I'm also the author and producer of The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing.

In the aughts, I got my start by working as a photographer for NGO clients in East Asia.

I grew up in the US, China and Japan.

Most of the notes on this website are utilitarian. A few are weird! I am sharing these ideas hoping that a few will be interesting to you, too.

I want to keep my URLs consistent but give ideas space to wiggle around. Expect rewrites, edits, combinations, dissections and the occasional deleted page. I'm working with a particular sort of iteration in mind.

The [Github repo] for this website's code is open. Here are the ingredients I'm using:

+ Building with Jekyll on GitHub Pages
+ Delivery via Cloudflare CDN
+ Managing search snippets with Google Webmaster tools

I really want this website to work for you -- Even if you're on an old phone. Even if you're standing outside an airport waiting for the bus. Even if the library wi-fi is slow as hell.

Let me know how it works for you:<br/>
