These days I'm working as a ranch hand in Texas, in the good company of ancient oak trees.

Previously, I worked as a photographer for NGO clients in East Asia.

I received an undergraduate degree in Asian Studies at St. Olaf College, Minnesota, in 2006; and a certificate in Chinese as a Second Language from Shanghai Huashida in 2004.

I grew up in the US, China and Japan.
