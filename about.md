I'm the author and producer of [The Photographers Field Guide to Beijing,] which is a little book you can read on your phone.

These days I'm working as a ranch hand in Texas, in the good company of ancient oak trees.

Previously, I worked as a [photographer] for NGO clients in East Asia.

I grew up in the US, China and Japan.
