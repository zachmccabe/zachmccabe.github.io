description: What I wish I knew when I started out as a NGO photographer

---


Figuring I could be a useful human by putting my cameras to work, I jumped into photography by hiring myself out to NGO clients. I had a lot to learn.

Postcards to my younger self in 140 characters or less.



## Am I a propagandist?

Choose your partners well. Photographers work for NGOs because they share a common vision. Nobody thinks you here for the money.



## Brass tacks, tactfully

Hash out expectations with your client ASAP. Always act pro: cross-cultural negotiations confuse clients, too.



## Good intentions?

Gratis or commissioned, the work is the same. 1. How will you solve the client's problem? 2. Costs, logistics & deliverables?



## Always bring extra

Small bills. Snacks to share with rogue livestock. Put fresh batteries in your right pocket and spent batteries in your left pocket.



## WYSIATI & culture shock

"What you see is all there is," says Kahneman. You can retrain bias with time. You don't have time, so move slow.



## Who trusts who?

Try to understand what you're asking for with your cameras. Trust can take minutes or months depending on a client's local relationships.



## Don't look away

Give your subject respect. Give your clients and their audience honest work. You don't need to give the cynics anything.



## Really, it is \*your\* job to smile

Build rapport first. If you rock up and take pictures, who will give you their story -- or anything else?



## Build rapport?

Share your pictures. Participate in kids games, drinking games, planting crops. Play the fool. Listen. You will be given permission, or not.



## Always be improvising

Don't worry if you'll have enough time, light or coverage â€“ you won't. Instead, clean your lens and count to 10.



## Trust goes both ways

Field managers can juggle tasks like a superhero but they can't read minds. Over-communicate. Make time for the team.



## Bad day?

Remember your role in the int'l media supply chain. When lesser evils fill your decision matrix, score the pictures and carry on.



## Post-processing?

This work has emotional costs. Create, and always keep, post-job rituals. Unpack and process your experience. Find sleep.



## Global power dynamics are fucked

Yep. Zoom in: Never underestimate a person's agency, or the local community, or your own bias to power.



## Practice

Remember that you're not the first photographer to face these challenges. These are things we all have to learn by doing, I think.
