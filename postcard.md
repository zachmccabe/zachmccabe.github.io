_Notes to my younger self. I was so arrogant it's doubtful I would've read this… but you are welcome to it!_


## Brass tacks, tactfully

This is a messy business. Hash out expectations with your client as early as possible.



## Always bring extra

Always bring extra camera batteries, and enough snacks to placate grouchy seat mates or rogue livestock.



## Don't look away

You owe your subjects respect. You owe your clients and their audience an honest story. You don't owe your cynics anything.



## Really, it is *your* job to smile

Build rapport before you photograph.



## Always be improvising

Always be ready to roll.




## Be someone to lean on

Field managers are experts at juggling tasks but they can't read minds. Communicate often. Make time to be a part of the team.



## Debriefing isn't therapy

There is an emotional cost to this work. Create, and keep, rituals for yourself to process your experience.



## Godspeed

These are things we all have to learn by doing, I think. Just know that you're not the first photographer to face these challenges. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
