## Another place

"Everything you're sure is right can be wrong in another place," observes the youngest character in Barbara Kingsolver's novel, The Poisonwood Bible.

When you're in another place, the signal:noise ratio falls through the floor. There are sudden, perplexing holes in all your conversations. You're under pressure to get the job done. Just when you need to think critically about your own assumptions -- you can't because you're overwhelmed.

It's okay to triage. Cross-cultural communication is hard.



## Be aware of context

Day-to-day, cultural context is so obvious you take it for granted, and so it is hard to see.

Your cultural background underpins your personal communication style.<sup>1</sup> You get input and feedback for what works starting when you're a baby. By the time you're grown, you make inferences about a person's intentions, based in part on the way that person talks to you.

You make day-to-day assumptions about how their communication habits "must" reflect a person's moral character, reliability, whatever.<sup>2</sup>

What happens when you aren't in your day-to-day? Here are 3 situations that get me into trouble:

Jet lag. When you're logy AF, the mind desperately wants the comfort of routine but you can't afford to "go with what you know." Beware the cozy cocoon.

On the job. When you're laser-focused, you ignore those pesky assumptions on the periphery but you know better. Beware the red mist before the deadline.

Stress. When you're hyper-vigilant, you'll label people's actions based on patterns that only matter in your own culture, or your own head. Beware the false positive.

The solution to dealing with these 3 situations is the same. Slow down. Some heuristics don't travel well. Question by question, you can start to chip away at those heuristics. You can navigate through tough conversations.

Learning to frame your questions so that they are "culturally adequate" takes practice. I find that cross-cultural communication can be *more* challenging when you're talking in your native language. Out of habit, it is easy to rely on the same phrases and postures that get you results in your own community. Culture is just shorthand for the entangled habits you and I share, isn't it?



### 3 simple strategies

+ Ask, don't assume: e.g., to avoid confusion right now
+ Ask differently: e.g., to make room for new info
+ Ask again: e.g., to avoid confusion later on



### Prep in 3 steps 

1. What do you know about the person you'll be asking?
2. What are you assuming with your question?
3. What's your goal with this question?



### Then, ask in 3 steps

4. Spend most of your energy listening.
5. Make space, and wait for an answer.
6. Keep track of your goal during the conversation.




## Know yourself

"The better you know yourself, the better you're able to hear other people," says Kate Murphy, the author of You're Not Listening: what you're missing and why it matters.<sup>3</sup>

After a taxing conversation, I know that I'll need to remind myself that I was able to obtain whatever it is I went in there asking about -- numbers 3 and 6 on the above list. If I didn't do that, I'd feel like shit about the emotionally-draining conversations I need to have, no matter how productive they really might be.




## Culturally adequate questions

When you're working across cultures or languages it's important to think about *how* you ask questions.

Although it took me a few years' worth of awkward conversations after moving back to the US, eventually I did learn that American's reputation for valuing blunt talk holds true. Questions delivered this way generally work well, too. (Maybe skewing a bit to business talk. Well-represented between both men and women. But then, I'm a white dude with an American accent. YMMV.)

Direct talk will have the opposite effect you want if you are an American in East Asia. The careful posturing that works so well at home won't have the same appeal in "another place." You won't come off as a confident straight shooter. You'll come off as juvenile, incompetent or hard to work with.

For example, in the United States and parts of Western Europe people generally expect direct talk: 

+ You ask me a question, and I give you a blunt answer. Culturally, this signals "honesty." That's good!
+ You'll avoid asking about things that are too personal. That'd be rude because you'd embarrass me – or both of us.

Meanwhile, in NE Asia people don't read it that way:

+ You ask me a question, and I avoid responding with a straightforward "no." That'd be rude because I'd embarrass you.
+ You ask about things that are personal but expect me to give you a vague answer. Culturally, this signals my "modesty." That's good!

Wherever you're from, you can think of some exceptions to patterns like these. Nevertheless, there are patterns. The questions we ask each other are built on top of our cultural expectations about how somebody "should" communicate.




## Notes

### Note 1

Read Andy Molinsky's "Cultural differences are more complicated than what country you’re from," in [HBR](https://hbr.org/2016/01/cultural-differences-are-more-complicated-than-what-country-youre-from) for some practical ideas.

Read Tarun Khanna's "Contextual intelligence," also in [HBR.](https://hbr.org/2014/09/contextual-intelligence) The piece will help you start mulling over just how hard it can be to grok culture's influence over your workaday perception of the world. If you're anything like me, a clear application to an abstract problem is motivating.

If you have access to an academic library, check out Christine Béal's paper, "Did you have a good weekend: or, why there is no such thing as a simple question in cross-cultural encounters." The abstract is available on [ResearchGate.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234558796_Did_You_Have_a_Good_Weekend_Or_Why_There_Is_No_Such_Thing_as_a_Simple_Question_in_Cross-Cultural_Encounters)



### Note 2

>"When two actors meet who have different models for recognizing and dealing with these sorts of problems, and when their respective models are backed up in their eyes by some special authority, authenticity, or feeling of rightness that may range all the way from ecclesiastical or sacred morality to self-evident common sense, *then* we may begin to speak of cultural difference."
>
>"Notice that culture appears as a sort of optical or perceptual illusion here: although always a presence, it can best be seen when thrown into relief by the quality of *difference*. For if two actors meet who share the same model or schema for dealing with, say, the power asymmetry evident between them, then culture is invisible, part of and buried in the deepest, and in this case, shared, context of their encounter."

### Note 3

Kate Murphy interview with [Krys Boyd.](https://think.kera.org/2020/03/12/why-no-one-listens-to-you/) Quote pulled from 27:26 in the interview.

Getting into a conversation is like getting into your car: You know you've got blind spots – that's why you use the car's mirrors. Know what frustrates you. Know what your tender spots are. Knowing yourself will give you a mirror for those conversational blindspots.  Know when when to slow down and you can avoid misreading the other person, says Murphy.
