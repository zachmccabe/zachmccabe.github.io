It didn't matter whether we were in Osaka or in our tiny, midwest college town. My college friend always kept his Seiko set to west coast time. You can do the math in your head, sure, but are you going to remember to call your mom after a soju-drowned weekend?

Travel can be disorienting, too. You put all of your attention on the overstimulating events in front of you. Zooming out and remembering the rest of your work and personal relationships can be a challenge.

When I need to, I adopt my watch-wearing friend's strategy.

When I need to keep up with a series of  calls spanning 10 timezones and 3 people, the first thing I reach for is my old Casio.

But, Zach, come on. Why so retro? It's 2021 -- the human population on this planet has been living through Zoom calls for a year. Why not just add a clock widget to your phone screen? You could! I like having the physical reminder on my arm. And, okay, I guess have been doing this for a while. I'm not bragging. I'm laughing at myself -- Christ! When I moved away after 2nd grade my best friend sent me a dispatch from his summer adventures via cassette tape. I flipped the tape over, narrated my reply and sent it back.

When a friend is going through a rough time, I set my watch to UTC +11 and check in once a week.

When I am going through a rough time, I set my watch to UTC +8 and check in with a friend once a week.

Awhile back, I was talking with a client in the US who had no idea that, officially, Beijing time is used for all of China -- despite that country spanning 62 degrees longitude. (That's more than the contiguous US, which spans 57 degrees, and is split into 4 timezones.) If you schedule a call first thing in the morning Beijing time, it's going to feel like the middle of the night to a colleague out in the western-half of China.

It's a good idea to confirm the timezone when you're planning a call.

Awhile back, I was chatting with a friend who'd lived on the west coast of the US for several years. She was stressed out and studying for her PhD. She hadn't realized that the US has multiple timezones, much less that it was hours later for me than it was for her. Groggy and preoccupied with thoughts of work in the morning, I was less focused on the conversation than I would have liked. She was embarrassed that after years of living in the country, she didn't know this simple fact about the place.

People assume their frame of reference is also your frame of reference.

I'm listening to an [interview] with NASA operations engineer Nagin Cox: Because her team needs to work during the Martian night, when their solar-powered rover sleeps, they adopt Mars time.

An Earth day is 40 minutes shorter than a Mars sol. As a mission progresses, the team becomes increasingly disoriented from the time on the ground at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, and syncs with Mars time for their 90-sol-long missions. They black out their windows. They use words like "yestersol" and "nextersol" to talk about their schedule. And they wear custom-tweaked watches. All of this is so cool it bends my mind.

Do what you have to do to get yourself on Mars Time.

I buy the cheapest knockoff Rolex I can find and it keeps me on schedule. (The watch is *so* cheap it stops working almost immediately after I buy it.) But I still remember to touch base with my client from the China-Myanmar border. I remember to text my girlfriend from the Mexico-US border. Having this silly bauble banging around on my wrist is a good way to remember the stuff that matters.

All this assumes there is a signal. Obviously, there is not always a signal. Plan for that.

It's the social signaling that often takes the most effort. Especially when you're tired and everything *feels* far away, it can be hard to know what to say.

Lately, I've been trying to use cues, tiny scripts, to keep the conversation on track. The "vibe check" is one I've been using a lot. If something wild is happening, like a natural disaster or human-inspired fuckery, I will just address it right away:

- Hi. Just checking in. Heard about the \[disaster\] in \[place\]. What's the vibe in your neighborhood?

This script helps me get a better idea of the other person's state of mind, and the environment around them. The idea is to intentionally, but gently, solicit all that background info you need before the start of a conversation, without being annoying:

- I know you're busy dealing with \[disaster\]. Would it be better to talk about \[work topic\] another day?

Be sensitive to the emotional payload. This is not easy to suss this out from far away, I know. I try to use news alerts, along with light background research to get into the right headspace.

People in stressful situations might need to vent. I try to prepare myself for this. Sometimes, I need to set the phone down mid-rant and take a few deep breaths. Other times, people would rather focus on something else:

- You want me to talk for awhile?

Speaking of minimizing stress, NATO phonetics are very useful during voice conversations. Choppy audio and loud background noises never seem to happen during the boring bits of a conversation. You can guess your way through a story. What about a booking code or surname?

Use NATO phonetics to get the details right. A friend taught me a great trick to build fluency: Practice at red lights using license plates and street signs. Spell out as many as you can before the light turns green. Main Street is "Mike Alpha Igloo November."

The "why-first" script is another favorite. After stating my motivation, my why, I'll make my request or pass along some piece of information.

- \[Intention\] + \[information\]

- Just wanted to update you. I'm at \[airport 1\] and expect to arrive at \[airport 2\] by \[date\] + \[time\] + \[timezone\].

- Let's be sure I get you what you need. \[Rephrasing client's instructions\]. Is that right?

People are busy with their own lives. Confusion can creep into the conversation when people have different expectations -- like when day for me is literally night for you. Front-load the rationale for what you're about to say, and you can mitigate some of that.

- Sorry, I don't understand. My \[2nd language\] isn't as good as I'd like. Will you explain \[confusing phrase\] again?

- Just confirming that we're scheduling the call for \[time\] + \[am/pm\] + \[client's timezone\], is that right?
