+ I put 6 of my favorite books on cross-cultural communication into this [reading list.] Try one.
+ No signal? Some tactics I like for communicating across [timezones.]
+ [Far away, and asking dumb questions.] Toddlers, therapists and some of the smartest people I've met all use silly questions to get results that are seriously impressive. I'm trying to learn from them.
+ Postcards from an NGO photographer. 140 characters on what I learned [the hard way.]
